Upon launching the program, users are presented with a menu containing several choices. They can use the arrow keys or input the corresponding numerical option to select their desired category, such as drinks, sweets, or refreshments. Each category offers a list of available items, which are displayed with their respective prices. Users can select an item by inputting its corresponding code.

Once an item is selected, the program prompts the user to enter the quantity desired. Users can input the quantity using prompt, allowing for flexibility in selecting multiple items or specifying different quantities for each item. The program calculates the total cost based on the item's price and the chosen quantity.
